## Goals and Purpose

For this final project I am developing a personal home page.  The primary purpose of my site is to curate my professional online presence and provide basic information about myself, my research, provide links to a current curriculum vitae, and allow others to contact me. 

I do have a current site that will be the source of the content.  This site is hosted for free on Github.  A secondary goal of my project is to develop a site that can still be hosted on Github.  As Github sites must be static, no server side scripting (e.g. PHP or .htacess) will be used on the site.

*Audience:*

The primary audience for this site is myself and my collaborators.  In my work, I am often in need of quickly providing links to my work, publications, and code.  Having a single spot where I keep this information is of great value to me.  A secondary audience would be the general community of researchers and individuals interested in open science, lakes, landscape ecology, and cyanobacteria.
