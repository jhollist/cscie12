    <h2>Short Bio:</h2>
    <p>I work for the US Environmental Protection Agency's Atlantic Ecology Divsion                   where I study lakes and cyanobacteria. I am a landscape ecologist by training. The primary focus of my work is developing tools (GIS, R, Python etc.) to advance our groups research.</p>
    <h2>Why I am taking this class:</h2>
    <p>A big part of my job is combining datasets from multiple sources to answer questions pretaining to nutrients in lakes.  Increasingly these datasets are served up as web services.  Additionally, I am an Open Science advocate and believe that the results of my research should also be be made freely available and be easily discoverable.  As such a solid and fundamental understanding of modern web technologies is essential.  I am taking this class (as well as others) to build this foundation and go beyond just being self-taught hacker.</p>
